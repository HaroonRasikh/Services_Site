This website is built using Python Django for the backend, which helps manage data and user interactions smoothly. On the front end, weâ€™ve used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and easy-to-navigate interface.
Every part of the site, including the menu names, can be easily added and managed by the admin.
